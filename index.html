      <h1 class="mb-4"> Responsive Re-design of Restaurant Website</h1>
        <p>For this project, I redesigned the followng website: <a href="https://www.hengpvd.com/home">HENG Thai & Rotisserie</a>. I selected this website due to its poor visual appeal, lack of readability, lack of responsive elements and insufficient affordances for efficiently navigating food ordering methods. The website has notable usability issues, making it an excellent candidate for a comprehensive redesign.</p>

      <p> For better readability, use full-screen mode by pressing the icon in the top right of the panel below.</p>

      <h1 class="mb-4">Usability Problems Observed in Original Website</h1>

      <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Accessibility, Learnability, Memorability</h2>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Lack of Iconography:</strong> Ordering options do not have associated icons, reducing learnability as users may struggle to quickly identify ordering methods.</li>
          <li><strong>Inconsistent Styling:</strong> Ordering options are not logically grouped or consistently styled, impacting efficiency and memorability.</li>
          <li><strong>Poor Information Hierarchy:</strong> The main panel lacks variation in text styling and layout, making it difficult for users to differentiate content significance and relationships.</li>
          <li><strong>Illegible Button Text:</strong> The “Order Here” button has low contrast due to white text against a patterned background, affecting readability and usability.</li>
          <li><strong>Misleading Link Styling:</strong> The phone number is underlined, suggesting it is a web link; however, it initiates a phone call without any color distinction, potentially confusing users.</li>
          <li><strong>Inconsistent Hover States:</strong> Buttons have inconsistent hover states, making it unclear which elements are interactive, negatively affecting learnability.</li>
          <li><strong>Poor Header Visibility:</strong> The header “HENG Thai &amp; Rotisserie” has readability issues due to a busy background and insufficient text contrast.</li>
          <li><strong>Small Footer Text:</strong> Footer content uses very small and lightly colored text, significantly reducing legibility and accessibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Navigation Visibility:</strong> Navigation dots indicating scroll position are not always visible, impacting user orientation.</li>
          <li><strong>Non-Responsive Design:</strong> Shrinking the browser window on desktop devices results in critical ordering buttons and menu items being cut off, forcing unnecessary scrolling and reducing usability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h4 mt-5">WAVE Accessibility Evaluation</h2>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Missing Alternative Text:</strong> Multiple images lack descriptive alternative text, significantly affecting screen reader accessibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Empty Headings:</strong> Empty headings are improperly used as spacers, negatively impacting screen reader navigation and focus order.</li>
          <li><strong>Text Size Issues:</strong> Certain text elements are excessively small, negatively impacting readability and accessibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Misleading Underlines:</strong> Some underlined text is not associated with links, creating confusion about interactive elements.</li>
          <li><strong>Heading Skips:</strong> WAVE flagged skipped heading levels as issues; however, skipped headings are acceptable if the overall information hierarchy remains logical and clear.</li>
          <li><strong>Contrast Issues:</strong> Despite WAVE not detecting contrast issues, manual inspection reveals significant readability problems with the “Delivery” button and header titles, confirming the presence of contrast-related accessibility concerns.</li>
      </ul>

    <h1 class="mb-4">Website Redesign</h1>
    <p>
      The panel below showcases the Design Guide and Mock-ups I created before developing the re-designed website.
      <br>
      I first created the design guide to address issues identified when analyzing the original website, and then created a figma prototype before implementation. The new and improved design achieves the following:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Simplified color scheme with high contrast to improve accessibility.</li>
      <li>Additional icons so users can better understand interactions. For example, the Doordash and Online Pickup icons indicate external platforms, and a phone icon shows that clicking calls the restaurant.</li>
      <li>Clear hierarchy through appropriate font styles and placement of elements.</li>
      <li>Consistent hover states across all buttons and navigation items.</li>
      <li>Larger footer text to enhance accessibility.</li>
      <li>A responsive layout that efficiently scales and repositions items for different devices.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      For better readability, use full-screen mode by pressing the icon in the top-right of the panel below.
